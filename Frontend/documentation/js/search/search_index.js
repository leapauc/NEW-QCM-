différents niveaux d'accès (droits)\n\nPrérequis\nAngular prérequis :\nLe projet Angular nécessite l'installation de quelques librairies indispensables à son bon fonctionnement :\n\nbootstrap\nbootstrap-icons\n@compodoc/compodoc\n\nL'installation peut se faire avec les commandes suivantes :\nExample :npm install bootstrap\nnpm i --save-dev @types/bootstrap\nnpm install bootstrap-icons\nnpm install --save-dev @compodoc/compodocAutre prérequis :\nLe frontend Angular communique avec un backend NodeJS qui répond sur :\nExample :http://localhost:3000Différentes urls sont disponibles et permettent de réaliser de nombreuses requêtes dans la base de données.\nDocumentation\nLa documentation Angular est disponible dans le dossier documentation, mais également à l'url suivante :\nExample :http://localhost:8081Contenerisation\nL'ensemble du projet est contenu dans un conteneur docker.\nIl suffira donc de lancer le conteneur docker pour pouvoir accéder à l'application.\nLa commande à executer est la suivante :\nExample :docker compose up --build\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n
