défini)\n * - Déterminer automatiquement le type de question (single/multiple) selon le nombre de réponses correctes\n * - Sauvegarder les modifications via le service `QuestionService`\n * - Afficher un modal de succès ou d'échec avec Bootstrap\n *\n * Il utilise les services suivants :\n * - `QcmService` : pour récupérer les QCM et leurs questions\n * - `QuestionService` : pour récupérer et mettre à jour les questions et leurs réponses\n *\n * Le formulaire est un formulaire réactif (`ReactiveFormsModule`) avec un `FormArray` pour les réponses.\n *\n * @example\n * ```html\n * \n * ```\n

(\\`.hbs\\` files): Handlebars templates for generating documentation pages\n- **Styles** (\\`.css\\` files): Stylesheets for customizing the appearance\n- **Scripts** (\\`.js\\` files): JavaScript files for additional functionality\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extract this ZIP file to a directory on your system\n2. Use the \\`--templates\\` flag when running Compodoc to specify the path to your custom templates:\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   compodoc -p tsconfig.json --templates ./path/to/custom/templates/\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout,

  Validateur Angular personnalisé pour vérifier le type d'une question de QCM.\nCe validateur est utilisé dans les formulaires réactifs (ReactiveForms) pour\ns'assurer que le champ type d'une question contient uniquement l'une des valeurs\nautorisées : \"single\" ou \"multiple\".\nUsage typique dans un FormGroup :\nExample :this.questionForm = this.fb.group({\n  question: ['', Validators.required],\n  type: ['', [typeValidator()]]\n});Exemple de résultat :\n\n\"single\" → valide\n\"multiple\" → valide\n\"other\" → retourne { invalidType: true }\n\n\n\n

des questionnaires et d’éviter l’étape de numérisation des\nquestionnaires papier, LECLIENT souhaite pouvoir disposer d’outils informatiques et multimédias\npermettant :\n\nde récupérer la base de questions existantes dans l’application QCM PLUS.\nde créer de nouvelles questions en ligne avec des protocoles d’activités de type QCM et d'importer\nles ressources nécessaires\nd'ajouter les questions dans des questionnaires\nde créer/modifier/supprimer des questionnaires\nd’effectuer en ligne et à distance le questionnaire\nde conserver et d'afficher le dernier résultat d'un stagiaire\nde gérer les différents niveaux d'accès (droits)\n\nPrérequis\nAngular prérequis :\nLe projet Angular nécessite l'installation de quelques librairies indispensables à son bon fonctionnement :\n\nbootstrap\nbootstrap-icons\n@compodoc/compodoc\n\nL'installation peut se faire avec les commandes suivantes :\nExample :npm install bootstrap\nnpm i --save-dev @types/bootstrap\nnpm install bootstrap-icons\nnpm install --save-dev @compodoc/compodocAutre prérequis :\nLe frontend Angular communique avec un backend NodeJS qui répond sur :\nExample :http://localhost:3000Différentes urls sont disponibles et permettent de réaliser de nombreuses requêtes dans la base de données.\nDocumentation\nLa documentation est disponible dans le dossier documentation, mais également à l'url suivante :\nExample :http://127.0.0.1:3001Contenerisation\nL'ensemble du projet est contenu dans un conteneur docker.\nIl suffira donc de lancer le conteneur docker pour pouvoir accéder à l'application.\nLa commande à executer est la suivante :\nExample :docker compose up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n
