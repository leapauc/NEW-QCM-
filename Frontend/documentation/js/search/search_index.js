d’éviter l’étape de numérisation des\nquestionnaires papier, LECLIENT souhaite pouvoir disposer d’outils informatiques et multimédias\npermettant :\n\nde récupérer la base de questions existantes dans l’application QCM PLUS.\nde créer de nouvelles questions en ligne avec des protocoles d’activités de type QCM et d'importer\nles ressources nécessaires\nd'ajouter les questions dans des questionnaires\nde créer/modifier/supprimer des questionnaires\nd’effectuer en ligne et à distance le questionnaire\nde conserver et d'afficher le dernier résultat d'un stagiaire\nde gérer les différents niveaux d'accès (droits)\n\n\nContenerisation\nL'ensemble du projet (backend, base de données et frontend) est contenu dans un conteneur docker.\nIl suffira donc de lancer le conteneur docker pour pouvoir accéder à l'application.\nLa commande à executer est la suivante :\nExample :docker compose up --build\nDocumentation\nLa documentation Angular est disponible dans le dossier documentation sur le github suivant :\nExample :https://github.com/leapauc/NEW-QCM-mais également à l'url suivante :\nExample :http://localhost:8081\nPrérequis\nAngular prérequis :\nLe projet Angular nécessite l'installation de quelques librairies indispensables à son bon fonctionnement :\n\nbootstrap\nbootstrap-icons\n@compodoc/compodoc\n\nLa tâche est réalisé au cours de la création du conteneur docker.\nEn local, l'installation peut se faire avec les commandes suivantes :\nExample :npm install bootstrap\nnpm i --save-dev @types/bootstrap\nnpm install bootstrap-icons\nnpm install --save-dev @compodoc/compodoc** ATTENTION : au préalable, il faudra installer nodeJS. **\nAutre prérequis :\nLe frontend Angular communique avec un backend NodeJS qui répond sur :\nExample :http://localhost:3000Différentes urls sont disponibles et permettent de réaliser de nombreuses requêtes dans la base de données.\nLa documentation de l'API est disponible à l'url suivante :\nExample
